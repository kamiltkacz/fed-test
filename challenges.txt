Challenges and Solutions:


1) In the main.js file, on line 9, the mustache template was missing an "+" operator between dynamically inserted HTML elements.

* By using the developer console I was able to detect where the error was.

2) CSS was missing and the not targeting correct elements of the index.html file.

* I refactored and formatted the main.css file to make the page identical to the preview image.

3) Some HTML elements were missing accesibility attributes.

* I added aria-label tags to elements that were lacking text.

4) Styling of .reports dynamic div

* I used Flexbox for full size monitors and Grid for width of 768px and below.

5) Mustache instered temples was missing 2 values - "file_size" and "file_type".

* I inserted those values in the template.


I'm available for any questions you may have.
